# 2022/2023 Premier League Fantasy Helper and Predictor

Many football/soccer fans are very passionate and knowledgeable about their favourite teams and players. However, when it comes to Fantasy Premier League, many tend to struggle when picking players from the same or different teams for their fantasy squad. Fans tend to choose the wrong players or give up on a squad's player too soon. There are many factors in a fantasy team like goals, assists, clean sheets and other contributions. Well, this database is made to help out fans who want to be better fantasy users and beat their fellow competitors! The details of the database are broken down into 3 parts, team analysis, their best player and a prediction for the upcoming season. Using this database will allow fantasy players to gain better knowledge about each team's past season and the reasoning behind their results and position in the table. Each team in the league will include their record and major statistics to give the user better insight into the overall squad. Also, fans can find an in-depth analysis of each team's best player and stats to determine if they could be a good fit for their squad. The statistics for each player depending on the position they play (forward, midfielder, defender and goalkeeper). To finish off the player section the database will provide a prediction about a player's upcoming season to help out fantasy users pick their teams. Finally, there is the team prediction section of the database. This is where each Premier League will have a projected record and placement on the table. It will also explain why or how they could achieve a certain position. A limitation to this program is that you cannot plan out your fantasy team on this database. Also, users will only be able to view one player instead of a variety in a squad.
